# pui-css-code

A CSS code component that can be installed via this npm package.
This package provides all of the CSS you need to use the component.

By default, code blocks will not have syntax highlighting.

It is a wrapper around [Prism](http://prismjs.com).

```sh
npm install pui-prismjs
```

You will also need to include a Prism theme.

```sh
npm install prismjs-default-theme
# or
npm install prismjs-okaidia-theme
```


## Installation

```
npm install pui-css-code
```

## Usage

<pre class="pre-unstyled"><code>class Foo
  def bar
    puts 'hi'
  end
end</code></pre>
```
